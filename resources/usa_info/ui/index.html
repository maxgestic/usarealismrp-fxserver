					<h3 class="w3-text-white">Rules</h3>
					<div class="w3-left-align w3-text-white content-box">
						<h4><b>RDM &amp; VDM</b></h4>
						<p>Before a player can kill another player including the police & EMS, all players must be engaged in the active roleplaying scenario. You are not allowed to kill an individual without any roleplay, this also includes the use of vehicles.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="w3-left-align w3-text-white content-box">
						<h4><b>Realistic Behavior</b></h4>
						<p>All players shall conduct themselves in a <b>realistic</b> manner. Despite game mechanics, it is the player's responsibility to <b>act realistic</b>. This means don't continue driving like nothing happened after flying off a 200 foot cliff in your vehicle or smashing head on into a vehicle at 65 MPH. Make sure to use your best judgement when it comes to sticking to your role. Understand the boundaries that your character may have and try to stick within those boundaries!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="w3-left-align w3-text-white content-box">
						<h4><b>Metagaming</b></h4>
						<p>You are not allowed to use out of character information (like server ID numbers, the player list, etc) for in character things. For example, you cannot identify someone just by the player list if you have no valid RP reason to believe it could be that person. Another example would be watching a Twitch stream of another player in the server while playing.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="w3-left-align w3-text-white content-box">
						<h4><b>Cop Baiting</b></h4>
						<p>It is forbidden for players to deliberately get the attention or commit a crime infront of police officers.

					<div class="w3-left-align w3-text-white content-box">
						<h4><b>New Life Rule</b></h4>
						<p>No player shall decide if another is dead. It will be the responsibility of the downed player to decide their own fate. Should a player be able to receive medical help and be revived then the player shall live from the encounter and remember everything about the encounter. Should a player <b>NOT</b> be able to receive medical help but does choose to respawn then <b>they shall not remember the event that leads to them respawning</b>. Should a player decide that they are dead then they shall be sent to the morgue and they are to <span class="w3-text-red">DELETE THE CHARACTER</span> this means if you are dead then you are ending the character's existence.</p>
