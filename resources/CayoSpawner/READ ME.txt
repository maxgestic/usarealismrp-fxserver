Cayo Perico Freeroam and RP Improvements -- By TayMcKenzieNZ

Version 3.0.0


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Back story: 

The Cayo Perico Island was designed by Rockstar Games for Grand Theft Auto Online heists, therefore it is dark for the purpose of stealth.

Many people in FiveM like to roleplay, and I didn't like how dark the island was, or the fact that you needed a hopper just to visit the island,
so I added lights and many improvments, as well as requesting the native that
Rockstar Games uses to enable and disable the island, depending on where the player is on the map.

I do not in any way shape or form, claim the Cayo Perico Island, its assets or its' files as my own intellectual property.

All credits go to Rockstar Games, Taketwo Interactive, OpenIV, Codewalker, and MAFINS Menyoo trainer.

The ymap files contains over 200 lights to brighten up Cayo Perico.

There are 12 seperate ymaps to avoid having 200+ props loaded in by a singular ymap.

The ymaps consist of:

- Runway lights and a helipad

- Street lights around the main roads of the island

- Mansion Pool improvement and solid sun loungers, beach ball, floatie, tables and chairs etc

- Side doors opened and lift doors removed

- Animal cage door opened

- "working" lighthouse

- Illuminated Boat Shed near party area and beached whale

- Illuminated skull near grave, opposite party area


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Illuminated beach party area with buoys, DJ stand lights, bar lights and TVs - TVs are to work with hypnonema script. Again, this is NOT provided. For best results:

SCRIPTS:
--------

cayo_perico_entitysets.lua: 

This script contains the entitysets for El Rubio's safe.

You can request to have either the Pearl Necklace, Panther, or Pink Diamond appear in the safe under Rubio's mansion. 

You must only request one set at a time. (example, "pearl_necklace_set" and "pearl_necklace_set,1".

Refresh the resource after applying and it should appear in game.




client.lua:
-----------


This script contains all the IPLs and natives for making the island appear as well as Los Santos in your server. 
There may be some bugs when noclipping there too fast, teleporting, spectating a player or teleporting someone to you
if you happen to be on the island; Unfortunately I haven't found a solution to this as the natives were never intended
for allowing players to freely explore Cayo Perico in freeroam, hence the majority of the FiveM playerbase who are
frustrated about the long loading times due to the island resource, can't be bothered with the hopper, as it takes away
the freedom to RP and fly/drive a boat to/from the island.



config.lua:
-----------

Essentionally the same as client.lua, however when the player is in Los Santos, Cayo Perico is concealed, making it look like an endless pacific ocean of water. Approaching the island close enough will print "Switching to Cayo Perico..." in the F8 console.

I WILL NOT BE PROVIDING ASSISTANT FOR THE ISLAND ITSELF, IT IS NOT MY RESOURCE AND IS RIDDLED WITH COLLISION ISSUES.

THIS IS SIMPLY A PACK OF YMAPS TO **IMPROVE** THE ISLAND AND REMOVE COLLISIONS IF YOU ARE **REQUESTING** THE ISLAND VIA
NATIVES.
